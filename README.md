# Weather Dashboard
  
## This Work Day Scheduler uses [OpenWeather One Call API](https://openweathermap.org/api/one-call-api) to retrieve weather data for cities
  
-	It features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript and jQuery.
-	Uses `localStorage` to store persistent data.


## Edit below  !!!
-	Each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past (grey), present (red), or future (green)
-	When the save button for that timeblock is clicked, the text for that event is NOT saved in local storage (Work in progress)
